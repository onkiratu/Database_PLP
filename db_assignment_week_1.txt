Section A: Definitions
1.    Define the following key terms related to databases:

1.1.1.    Database
A database is a structured collection of data organized in a manner that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of information.

1.1.2.    Table
A table is a structured representation of data organized into rows and columns. 

1.1.3.    Record
A record represent individual instances of data stored in the table. Each row contains values corresponding to each column defined in the table.

1.1.4.    Field
A field, also known as a column or attribute, refers to a specific piece of data within a table.

1.1.5.    Primary Key
A primary key is a special type of field (or combination of fields) in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in the table.

1.1.6.    SQL
Structured Query Language; used for managing, querying, and manipulating relational databases; includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

1.1.7.    Query
A query retrieves specific data from a database based on defined criteria; executed using SQL commands like SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc.

1.1.8.    Index
Indexes in databases are data structures used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations by enabling faster lookup access.

1.1.9.    Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to minimize redundancy and dependency, enhancing data integrity and efficiency.

1.1.10. Database Management System (DBMS)
A database management system (DBMS) is software that manages databases, providing functionalities for storing, retrieving, updating, and securing data.

2.  Section B: Discussions
2.1.1.    Describe the purpose of a primary key in a database table and provide an example.
A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a database table, ensuring data integrity and enabling efficient data retrieval. Example: "ID" column in a "Students" table.

2.1.2.    Explain the difference between a database management system (DBMS) and a database.
A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation. A database management system (DBMS) is software used to manage, access, and manipulate databases.

2.1.3.    Discuss in short, the importance of normalization in database design and provide an example of how it can improve data integrity.
Normalization in database design reduces redundancy and dependency, enhancing data integrity and efficiency. For example, by separating customer information into separate tables (e.g., Customers and Orders), we avoid repeating customer details for each order, minimizing data duplication and potential inconsistencies.
